# MySQL & JDBC

# 📅 (Date: 10-Feb-2026) : MySQL

Worked on designing, querying, and managing relational databases using MySQL. Practiced real-world database operations including schema design, data manipulation, performance optimization, and transaction handling.

**Covered key concepts including:**

 - Understanding relational database structure (tables, rows, columns)
 - Working with primary keys and foreign keys
 - Writing SQL queries (SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE)
 - Using WHERE, ORDER BY, GROUP BY, and HAVING clauses
 - Performing JOIN operations (INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN, RIGHT JOIN)
 - Applying constraints (NOT NULL, UNIQUE, DEFAULT, AUTO_INCREMENT)
 - Database normalization (1NF, 2NF, 3NF)
 - Creating indexes to improve performance
 - Working with aggregate functions (COUNT, SUM, AVG, MIN, MAX)
 - Managing transactions (COMMIT, ROLLBACK)
 - Creating stored procedures, views, and triggers
 - Handling user roles and database security
