Buffered Streams Performance Test File

This file is used to test file copy performance in Java.
It demonstrates the difference between normal file streams
and buffered streams.

BufferedInputStream and BufferedOutputStream
improve performance by reducing disk I/O operations.

This file can be duplicated multiple times
or extended to increase file size for performance testing.
