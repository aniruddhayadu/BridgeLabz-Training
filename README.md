# 📅 (Date: 29-Jan-2026) : CSV & JSON Data Handling in Java

Worked on reading, writing, parsing, and validating structured data formats commonly used in real-world applications. Practiced end-to-end data handling using both core Java and popular libraries.
Covered key concepts including:

 - Reading and writing CSV files using BufferedReader/Writer
 - Handling CSV data efficiently with OpenCSV
 - Mapping CSV records to Java objects (CsvToBean)
 - Validating CSV fields using regex and data checks
 - Understanding JSON structure (objects, arrays, nested data)
 - Creating, reading, writing, and parsing JSON using org.json, Gson, and Jackson
 - Dynamic JSON parsing with JsonNode and JSON schema validation

# 📅 (Date: 29-Jan-2026) : Scenario-Based Problems

Solved real-world scenario-based problems involving advanced Java concepts:

 - HealthCheckPro – Used custom annotations and reflection to scan API methods and auto-generate metadata/documentation
 - MarkMate – Processed student marks from CSV files and generated JSON report cards with totals, averages, and grades
 - EventTracker – Built an audit system using annotations and reflection to generate structured JSON logs for user actions
