# 📅 (Date: 05-Jan-2026) : Sorting Algorithms

Sorting algorithms arrange data in a specific order (ascending or descending). They are essential for efficient data processing and searching.

**Algorithms Covered**

 - Bubble Sort – Simple comparison-based algorithm; best for small datasets.
 - Insertion Sort – Builds the sorted list one element at a time; efficient for nearly sorted data.
 - Merge Sort – Divide-and-conquer algorithm; fast and stable for large datasets.
 - Quick Sort – Highly efficient divide-and-conquer algorithm; commonly used in practice.
