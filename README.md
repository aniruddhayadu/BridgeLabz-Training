# 📅 (Date: 05-Jan-2026) : Sorting Algorithms

Sorting algorithms arrange data in a specific order (ascending or descending). They are essential for efficient data processing and searching.

**Algorithms Covered**

 - Bubble Sort – Simple comparison-based algorithm; best for small datasets.
 - Insertion Sort – Builds the sorted list one element at a time; efficient for nearly sorted data.
 - Merge Sort – Divide-and-conquer algorithm; fast and stable for large datasets.
 - Quick Sort – Highly efficient divide-and-conquer algorithm; commonly used in practice.

# 📅 (Date: 06-Jan-2026) : Java Basics & Searching Techniques

This document covers essential Java classes for string handling, file reading, and basic searching algorithms. These are fundamental for efficient Java programming and data processing.

**Topics Covered**

### 1. StringBuilder
- Mutable sequence of characters; allows modification without creating a new object.
- Efficient for concatenating strings in loops or frequent modifications.
  
### 2. StringBuffer
- Similar to `StringBuilder` but thread-safe (synchronized).
- Ideal for multithreaded environments where multiple threads modify the same string.

### 3. FileReader
- Reads character files; suitable for reading text data.
- Works with `BufferedReader` for efficient reading of large files line by line.

### 4. InputStreamReader
- Bridges byte streams to character streams.
- Commonly used with `System.in` to read input from the console.

### 5. Linear Search
- Sequentially checks each element in a list until the target is found.
- Simple but inefficient for large datasets (O(n) time complexity).

### 6. Binary Search
- Efficient searching algorithm for sorted arrays.
- Divides the search space in half repeatedly (O(log n) time complexity).
